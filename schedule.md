## Data Labs

This class highlights two themes:

1. Data is easier to obtain than ever before.
2. Organizations that use data effectively perform better.

So how can we get better at using data? 

**Learning Objectives**: These labs are designed to better understand the process of collecting and utilizing data. The emphasis is on building a strategy to identify high-value data that is most useful for the organization, which requires basic knowledge about data quality. Does the data provide the type of information that is useful for discovery or prediction, and does it measure outcomes precisely?







** Week 1 - Regression Review


*** { @unit = "", @title = "Course Overview", @lecture }


*** { @unit = "", @title = "The Value of Data", @reading  }


*** { @unit = "Due July 7th", @title = "Lab 01", @assignment, @foldout  }
