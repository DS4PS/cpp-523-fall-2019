# Solutions



### Question 1.

#### Part 1


Consider a three-variable regression of Subjective Well-Being (SWB), Network Diversity (ND) and Perceived Social Support (PSS):

$SWB=β_0+β_1 \cdot ND+β_2 \cdot PSS+e$

```{r results="asis"}
m.full <- lm( SWB ~ ND + PSS, data=dat )

stargazer( m.full, 
           type = "html", digits=2,
           dep.var.caption = "DV: Subjective Well-Being",
           omit.stat = c("rsq","f","ser"),
           notes.label = "Standard errors in parentheses")
```


Calculate the omitted variable bias on the Network Diversity (ND) coefficient that results from omitting the Perceived Social Support (PSS) variable from the regression. **You can read these values from the table above.**

$SWB=b_0+b_1 \cdot ND+e$

```{r}
B1 <- 0.00 # 
b1 <- 0.00 
bias <- b1 - B1
bias
```


```{r, results="asis"}
m.full <- lm( SWB ~ ND + PSS, data=dat )
m.naive <- lm( SWB ~ ND, data=dat )

stargazer( m.naive, m.full, 
           type = "html", digits=2,
           dep.var.caption = "DV: Subjective Well-Being",
           omit.stat = c("rsq","f","ser"),
           notes.label = "Standard errors in parentheses")
```




#### Part 2 


![](figures/path-diagram.png)

Run the auxiliary regression to estimate $\alpha_1$.

Calculate the bias using the omitted variable bias equation and show your math.  You can check your results by comparing your answer to bias calculation from **Part 1**.


```{r, results="asis"}
m.auxiliary <- # your model here

stargazer( m.auxiliary,  
           type = "html", digits=2,
           dep.var.caption = "DV: PSS",
           omit.stat = c("rsq","f","ser"),
           notes.label = "Standard errors in parentheses")

a1 <- 
B2 <- 
bias <- 
bias
```

#### Part 3

How good is the naive estimation of β1, the impact of network diversity on our happiness, in this case?

```{r, eval=F}
b1 / B1  # rough measure of the magnitude of bias
```

### Question 2.



#### Part 1

What happened to the slope of CSE?  
What happened to the standard error of CSE?  

How would our assessment of CSE change after we control for baseline self-esteem? For example, if we are a psychologist working with students should we worry if we observe a case where a person has a high need for approval from others? Will it impact their happiness? Or should we focus on other things? 


#### Part 2

In Quesion 2 the control variable cased the slope estimate for Network Diversity to shift to the left toward the null hypothesis (slope=0, no impact) and as a result it lost statistical significance. 

What happens in this case? Why did that happen? Drawing the coefficient plot might help. 



#### Part 3

Explain the direction of bias in this model using the formula for omitted variable bias: what must be true about the sign of the correlation between RSE and CSE to get these results?

$bias = \alpha_1 \cdot B_2$

|  $\alpha_1$  | $B_2$  | Sign of Bias |  
|--------------|--------|:------------:|  
|  (+)  |  (+)  |  (+)  |  
|  (-)  |  (-)  |  (+)  |  
|  (+)  |  (-)  |  (-)  |  
|  (-)  |  (+)  |  (-)  |
